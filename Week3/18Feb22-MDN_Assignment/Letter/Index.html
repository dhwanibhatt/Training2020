                <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
                <p>
                    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the
                    subjects
                    fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You sestrong like an intelligent, dedicated
                    researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you
                    submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority.
                </p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
                        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tstrongpratures exceeding 30℃ (86℉),
                        when
                        the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)
                    </li>
                    <li><abbr title="hypertext markup language"> HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"> CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd
                    expect
                    the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to
                    know?
                    Thanks.

                    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To
                        answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:

                            Polynesian chicken dance 
                            <p class="psection">
                            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,
                            a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be
                            "fruitful".

                            Icelandic brownian shuffle 
                            <p class="psection"> 
                            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they
                            used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,
                            and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movstrongents. One of my
                            fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.

                            Arctic robot dance 
                            <p class="psection">
                            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the
                            1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted
                            movstrongents, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it
                            was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
